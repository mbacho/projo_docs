\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background}
\paragraph{}
The World Wide Web is an expansive system of interlinked information including text, audio and visual media. This information is stored in web servers and accessed using a web browsers provided there is a connection from the web browser to the web server e.g. internet connection. A website is a collection of related web pages served from a single web domain hosted by one or more web servers. The World Wide Web is composed of all websites that are available publicly.

In today's era of the internet, websites have become a major avenue through which information is shared. Websites range from fully fledged web applications to simple personal pages to complex institution pages. Companies, institutions and individuals use to websites to post information about themselves, topics of interest, ideas etc. Websites have become so integrated within the society that they are now being used to achieve more than just information sharing. Reasons for developing websites are as many as the uses of websites. They include communication, information sharing, business, banking, entertainment, gaming and many more.

Most of the information published in websites is targeted at a certain audience. \begin{review_comment}{Examples of previous statement}{orange}

However, the information providers may not know if the information is effective in achieving their goal of information dispersing to their target audience. Thus, website owners and administrators need a tool to help them assess the impact of their website. This project aims to help website owners to analyse and determine the effectiveness of their websites.


\section{Problem Statement}
\paragraph{}
This project will focus on one institution, the University of Nairobi (UoN). The institution was chosen because there has been a need for analysis of it's website within the institution itself. The university's website is particularly important since it should reflect the academic excellence of the university.
\paragraph{}
The university has a system of websites under the domain 'uonbi.ac.ke'. Under the domain 'uonbi.ac.ke', units within the  University of Nairobi have sub domains. These units include colleges, schools, faculties, institutes, centres, university staff and student organizations and university service providers. The system of websites is governed by a policy. According to the university's website policy, the main objectives for the website are:
\begin{itemize}
\item To ensure accuracy, consistency, integrity of the content and protection of the identity and image of the University.
\item To improve the University's visibility regionally and internationally and create a strong brand in line with the University's Strategic Plan.
\item To provide a set of mandatory guidelines for the University of Nairobi System of Websites
\item To guide the maintenance of the web content and evolution of the System of Websites to ensure continued reflection of the true status of the University within its web space.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{}
In order to know the effectiveness of the system of websites, analysis needs to be done to determine the impact of the system of websites. An example of this analysis is the webometrics ranking of universities in which.
\paragraph{}
Currently, there is no effective method to analyse and determine the effectiveness and impact of the system of websites by the university itself. This is especially important to learning institutions since they need to know the impact they have on their intended audience.  Such analysis would be helpful in determining whether the system of websites is upholding the set policy.


\section{Project Justification}
Provision of information about the effectiveness and impact of websites will enable website administrators to make more informed decisions. For example, they would know when to improve on their website or policies governing the same.
