\section{Using the system}
\subsubsection{Registration}

\noindent
To use the system, a user needs to register and provide a valid email which would be used to relay notifications from the system.
\subsubsection{Creating a project}

\noindent
The system does analysis of domains around a project structure. A project is an instance of analysis in which the system analyses the user-provided domains for analysis. Analysis for each individual domain is generated and used to compare between the given domains. 

\noindent
The user creates a new domain by supplying a unique and valid project name. After this, the user gives the domains or subdomains to be analysed.
